        Dear Dean,
    </p>
    <p>
        This is to inform you that Devsnest is orgainising is a 30 day code camp for beginners. I attended this camp the past month was overwhelmed by the quality of knowledge I gained during this short time. So, I request you to please grant the permission so that they can organise this camp for the students of the university.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yours sincerely,<br>
        Kenneth Beare<br>
        Director of Ken's Cheese House<br>
